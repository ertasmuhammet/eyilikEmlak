# EyilikEmlak

EyilikEmlak project is for Real Estate and it provides upload, delete and update adverts by admin easily. In this project,  Angular was used for frontend and JsonServer was used for datas. The project continues to be developed. I aim to use .NET for backend and use JWT authentication.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Install

Install ANGULAR CLI --> npm install -g @angular/cli

Install JSON Server --> npm install -g json-server

Install multer --> npm install express multer

Install nodemon --> npm install -g nodemon

## Build

Run json server --> json-server --watch db.json

Run nodemon --> nodemon index.js

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
